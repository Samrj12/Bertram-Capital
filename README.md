# Bertram Capital Coffee Payment

## Assumptions:
 We are assuming that we know would the next payer before transactions.
 Also, at the end of all transactions, the code displays the balances that mentions how much amount each coworker is owed or owes.

## Usage:
 The program expects two args:
 1) Number of coworkers (To make the program applicable to other cases as well; for the given problem we can just use 7)
 2) Number of transactions (After the last transaction the code exists)

## Note:
 We could use a 2D array of balances to actually know how much amount each coworker owes to the other coworker. However, for this problem, it was not necessary.
